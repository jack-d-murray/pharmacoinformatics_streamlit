# Streamlit App for the Pharmacoinformatics Database

This page shares an interactive Streamlit app associated with the submitted manuscript, *"Establishing a Pharmacoinformatics Repository of Approved Medicines: A Database to Support Drug Product Development"*

The Streamlit application supports two functionalities: *Explore the database* and *Explore association rules.* Note that data is not updated in real time and is not suitable to support clinical decision-making.
